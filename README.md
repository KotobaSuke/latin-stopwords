# Latin Stopword List

The wordlist (`latin`) is a stopword list for processing Classical Latin literatures, which can be opened as a `.txt` file.

The list is not complete, with words collected by me with personal judgement and bias.
The words in the list are in lowercase and unlemmatized, i.e. different forms of a single lemma are listed individually. Due to some restrictions, not all forms of a stopped word are listed.
