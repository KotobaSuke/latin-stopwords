# Latin Stopword List

The wordlist (`latin`) is a stopword list for processing Classical Latin literatures, which can be opened as a `.txt` file.

The list is not complete, with words collected by me with personal judgement and bias.

The words in the list are in lowercase and unlemmatized, i.e. different forms of a single lemma are listed individually. Due to some restrictions, not all forms of a stopped word are listed.

Most of the words that match the following conditions are included:
* Pronouns: *ego, tu, te, quis, quidam*
* Quantifications: *unus, duo, ullus, omne*
* Non-adjective-derivative adverbs: *mox, tunc, num, non*
* Conjunctions: *et, atque, sed, seu*
* Prepositions: *in, ad, trans, propter*
* Degree qualifications: *quantum, magis, minor, talis*
* Light verbs: forms of *esse, facere, habere, dicere*
* Other particles: *ecce, o*
* Classical name abbreviations: *c, agr, m, cn*
* Roman numerals: *i, ii, v, xl*
* Greek distractors: *kai, ton* (frequent in some contexts with Greek quotes)
